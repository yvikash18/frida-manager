Frida Manager is a cutting-edge Android application designed for security researchers, pentesters, and modders. It streamlines the deployment of Frida server binaries and provides a robust RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection) Detection suite to analyze how apps detect your environment.

With a beautiful Material Design 3 interface, it offers powerful tools like Wireless ADB Debugging, real-time logging, and one-click environment scans.

Key Features:

🚀 Advanced Server Management
*   Smart Installation: Auto-fetch and install the latest Frida binaries from GitHub.
*   Version Control: Save multiple Frida versions and switch between them instantly.
*   Auto-Heal: Automatically detects architecture and installs the correct binary.
*   Boot Persistence: Configure Frida server to start automatically on device boot.

🛡️ RASP & Environment Analysis
Detect if your environment is exposed to anti-tampering checks. Our native detection module scans for:
*   Maps & Smaps Scanning: Detects Frida libraries and anonymous executable memory.
*   Thread Analysis: Identifies suspicious threads (gmain, gum-js-loop, pool-frida).
*   File Descriptor Checks: Finds open handles to sensitive files.
*   Port Scanning: Detects default Frida ports (27042).
*   Native Hooks: Probes for hooked system libraries.

⚡ Power Tools
*   Wifi ADB Debugging: Toggle Wireless ADB with a single tap for cable-free research.
*   Logcat Integration: Built-in terminal to view and filter server logs in real-time.
*   Root Detection: Verifies root access integrity.

🎨 Modern Experience
*   Jetpack Compose UI: Smooth, reactive, and beautiful interface.
*   Dark Mode: Fully supported system-wide dark theme.
*   Dynamic Stats: Real-time server PID and version display.

Architecture Support:
*   ARM64: Modern Android Phones (Pixel, Samsung, etc.)
*   ARM: Older/Budget Devices
*   x86 / x86_64: Emulators (AVD, Genymotion)

Permissions:
The app requires specific permissions to function correctly:
*   ROOT: Essential for installing server binaries to /data/local/tmp and managing system services.
*   INTERNET: To fetch the latest releases from GitHub.
*   RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: For the auto-start feature.
*   POST_NOTIFICATIONS: To show server status in the notification shade.
